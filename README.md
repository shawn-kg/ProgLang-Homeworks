### CSCI 4430 
#### Programming Languages
# Programming Assignment #2
### Shawn George and Chrisanna Shen

Erlang was used for this programming assignment. Compile main.erl, dirService.erl, and fileServer.erl before running. Run using run_fixed.sh.

One feature we used was that we often used lists of tuples to keep track of files and their data. After running a script, we found that we would have to delete the *servers* and *downloads* folder.

There is no known bug at the moment.
